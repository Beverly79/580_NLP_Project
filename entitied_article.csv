Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.""I didn´t see anything bullish today"" for WTI, he said. ""Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.""New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world´s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.""It´s too low for everybody,"" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. ""I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term.""Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the world´s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.

19,"London: Global oil prices slid Wednesday following a three-day rally as dealers were divided on whether the commodity has bottomed out after a plunge of nearly 60 percent since June. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in March shed $1.72 to stand at $51.33 a barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for March slid $1.15 a barrel to trade at $56.76 in London afternoon trade.WTI had soared $3.48 Tuesday to record its highest finish since December 31, while Brent jumped $3.16 to a similar closing peak, as dealers cheered signs that the oil industry is tightening exploration activities to cap a supply glut.Ken Hasegawa, an energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo, said the crude market was ""extremely volatile"" after the three-day rally that began Friday saw prices surge nearly 20 percent.""It has become increasingly difficult to discern the direction of the prices of crude oil, but the fundamentals remain unchanged,"" Hasegawa told AFP. He added that prices could ""fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10"" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude supplies.

""Upon completion of the review, SDR 360 million (about US$518 million) would be made available to Pakistan, said the outgoing chief of the IMF Mission to Pakistan Jeffery Franks.Newly-announced Chief of IMF Mission to Pakistan, Herald Finger, will replace Franks after the talks.At a jointly held press conference with the IMF staff in Dubai, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar reiterated that there would be no increase in gas and electricity prices. Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar said that Pakistans foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion, entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. Tax revenues were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects of the plunge in international oil prices, said a press statement from the IMF mission. While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies, complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure public enterprises, noted the IMF.

The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world´s biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth for the last 15 years transforming the country into the worlds third largest producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.

133,"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Monday after OPEC decided to maintain its high output levels, while traders were also weighing the possible return of Iranian supplies that have been curtailed by international sanctions against Tehran, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 59 cents to $58.54 while Brent crude for July eased 56 cents to $62.75 in mid-morning trade. Analysts said investors were mulling the long-term impact on prices after the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday defied calls to cut output to alleviate a global supply glut that has seen prices slump almost 50 percent over the past year. Instead, they kept their collective target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY, said prices are ""likely to remain volatile"" ahead of a June 30 deadline for Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing Tehran´s nuclear programme.  Six global powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- are trying to nail down a deal to curb Iran´s nuclear ambitions by reducing its stockpiles of enriched uranium and mothballing some of its sites.If the agreement is reached and implemented, the powers have agreed to gradually scale back sanctions imposed since 2012, including on its petroleum industry. Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions. ""Any likelihood of a deal could act as a trigger for downward movement of crude prices,"" said Gupta. (AFP)

A sovereign with a Caa rating is judged to be of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.Weak government finances, structural inflationary pressures and domestic political uncertainties were adding to Pakistan's external vulnerabilities and debt sustainability, thereby compounding the downward pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, Moodys said.Moody's also said the downgrade was also prompted by an upcoming repayment of $7.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund.

The decrease in consumer prices is likely to come into effect under the head of fuel adjustment for the month of May, and would be applicable across Pakistan except for consumers of K-Electric. The Central Power Purchasing Agency has informed NEPRA in its recommendation that fuel adjustment charges on power production were set at Rs8.09 per unit for the month of May, but  fuel cost in May remained at Rs4.80 per unit.NEPRA will conduct a hearing into the matter on July 16.

The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912 million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015.

According to details, Rs19.75 billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline telephone subscribers. In the banking system the FBR recorded 30.5 million transactions including saving accounts, national saving schemes and cash withdrawals on which the tax authorities collected over Rs50 billion. The directorate so far issued 344,572 notices to defaulters. Around 72,000 persons filed returns and paid Rs485 million tax. Through those notices, the directorate created demand of Rs16.87 billion and recovered Rs6.42 billion.

180,"Shanghai: China´s central bank on Tuesday devalued its yuan currency by nearly two percent against the US dollar, as authorities seek to push market reforms and bolster the world´s second-largest economy.The surprise move marked the biggest drop since China reformed its currency system in 2005 by unpegging the yuan -- also known as the renminbi (RMB) -- from the greenback.It should make the country´s exports more competitive overseas, but analysts said it could prompt anger in the US.The People´s Bank of China (PBoC) set its daily reference rate for the yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan the previous day, effectively 1.86 percent lower.The change came amid speculation China is preparing to widen the yuan´s two percent trading band for the first time since March 2014.The range is calculated from a central ""reference rate"" each day. Before Tuesday, Chinese officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoC´s move means it will now also take into account the previous day´s close and other factors.Beijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currency´s value on fears major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce its control over the economy.That has made the yuan far more stable than other major global currencies and a two percent move in its value is dramatic -- before Tuesday´s announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4 percent band for four months.

Brent crude for October, a new contract, was down 65 cents to $48.54.WTI and Brent´s September contract rose in New York on Friday after closing at their lowest level in six and a half years in the prior session.But oil came under renewed pressure in Asia after the latest data showing the number of rigs drilling for US oil increased last week, the sixth rise in seven weeks, analysts said.The news added to fears of a prolonged global surplus as output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the United States remains robust despite the tumbling prices.""The combination of elevated stockpiles in the US and increasing production from OPEC, sluggish demand growth, and a stronger US (dollar) would continue to pressure oil prices,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The dollar strengthened in Asia on Monday after solid data boosted expectations of an imminent US rate rise, after China´s shock devaluation of the yuan last week hurt Asia-Pacific currencies.As oil is traded in the US currency, a strong dollar makes it more expensive for international investors, dampening demand.""The devaluation of the yuan by China led to the weakening of other emerging market currencies,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.""This spells negative news for crude as a strong US dollar makes crude expensive for importing countries, thereby curtailing demand.""Gupta said traders will be watching Chinese home prices data due for release Tuesday for further clues on the health of the world´s second-largest economy.Traders will also comb through the minutes of the US central bank´s meeting in late July, due for release Wednesday, for signs on when the Fed will raise interest rates.""We continue to expect further short-term downside in WTI crude over the next few months,"" the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said in a market commentary.

A reading below 50 signifies contraction in activity.The poor data fuelled concerns about the world´s second-largest economy and top energy importer -- already heightened by Beijing´s unexpected devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago -- at a time when high production levels and weak demand growth are weighing on prices.Oil dealers will next be scrutinising preliminary US second-quarter GDP data to be released on Thursday, analysts said.The data could be key to the Federal Reserve´s timeline for raising interest rates, with predictions for a September raise fading in the face of global growth jitters.Interest rate adjustments are closely watched by crude investors as an increase usually leads to a pick-up in the dollar.

190,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Tuesday that it is cognisant of the global developments related to markets and is keenly observing its impact on the domestic economy as well. SBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable going forward and may even strengthen depending on the relative movement of international currencies, said an SBP statement today.On Monday (August 24), financial markets across the globe witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets. Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent developments do not pose any serious challenge to it.Our external sector is robust and reserves are at historically high level.The statement added that, Nevertheless it is keenly watching the international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by their speculative activities. SBP stands ready to take any measure to ensure stability in the markets and will deal with such unscrupulous elements with strong measures.

191,"KARACHI: The Asian Development Bank said Tuesday it has approved a new assistance programme for Pakistan worth $1.2 billion annually, to improve infrastructure and create jobs. The Manila-based bank said Pakistan, which has suffered sluggish growth in recent years, was on track to meet targets for cutting poverty. But it said overall development was below potential and further institutional reforms were needed. Tax collection in Pakistan is tiny, severely hampering the government´s ability to manage its finances. A chronic crisis in the power sector -- made worse by poorly targeted subsidies -- is also a major brake on growth. ""The main challenge in Pakistan was to deliver higher, sustained and inclusive growth to cut poverty and create productive jobs for the growing labour force,"" ADB Pakistan country director Werner Liepach said in a statement. The new programme, which runs until 2019, will target six sectors including energy, transport and public sector management, the ADB said. The funds will support improvements to highways and provincial roads, as well as to power generation and transmission and bus rapid transit schemes in Karachi and other cities.

Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations  those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi.

The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.

Tokyo, which is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil, has maintained friendly relations with Tehran through its years of ostracism, keeping up diplomatic dialogue that many developed countries cut off decades ago.But Tokyo has reduced its Iranian oil imports in recent years under pressure from fellow developed powers backing the US-led sanction regime. There have also been no new Japanese investments in Iran since 1993, according to official data. There were approximately 30 Japanese firms operating in the country as of July last year, data showed.Iran has meanwhile praised Japan´s nuclear technology, even after the 2011 Fukushima crisis, and said more investment in Iran´s atomic sector could boost bilateral relations.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is also expected to visit Iran as early as next month to set up a bilateral committee to discuss energy and infrastructure development and other economic issues, Kyodo News said.

They said that after this strike, they will announce their future plans of protests and strikes which would be for an indefinite period.They said that businessmen had never refused to pay taxes, but the government instead of taxing those who were already in the net, should bring new people in to the tax net.They said that this tax had not only made life of the traders miserable, but also destroyed the whole banking sector, as it was now facing a collective loss of Rs878 billion.After the traders and business community, the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) also announced to observe the September 9 strike.

217,"KARACHI: The government believes that coal-based power generation is the best source of energy in the wake of depleting gas reserves.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said efforts must be made to change the energy mix towards cheaper fuels.With the depleting natural gas reserves in the country and relatively longer lead time for the construction of hydroelectric power projects, coal power plants are considered the best option in the short- and medium-term planning, reads a Nepras decision pertaining to the generation licence application of Siddiqsons Energy.NEPRA awarded a generation licence to Siddiqsons Energy Limited for 350-megawatt coal-based thermal facility at Port Qasim with a cost of approximately $600 million.The project is expected to be commissioned by December 31, 2018, while the company is required to provide a certificate on bi-annual basis, confirming that the operation of its generation facility is in line with the environment standards as prescribed by the relevant competent authority.NEPRA said electricity is a fundamental element for the economic growth of any country. The electricity consumption per capita has a strong correlation to the social development and economic indices.Increasing electricity consumption per capita can directly stimulate faster economic growth and indirectly achieve enhanced social development, the authority said.In short, the economic growth of any country is directly linked with the availability of safe, secure, reliable and cheaper supply of electricity.The authority said for sustainable development, all types of electric power generation resources, including coal (imported/indigenous), hydel, wind, solar and others must be tapped and developed on priority basis both in public and private sectors.The existing energy mix of the country is heavily skewed towards the costlier thermal generation facilities operating on furnace oil.The import of expensive furnace oil results in depletion of the precious foreign exchange reserves of the country, affecting the macro and microeconomic stability, read the ruling.An increase in the consumer end tariff results in higher inflation but it also affects the competitiveness of the local industry with its foreign peers.It further said it is vital that indigenous and imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their development is encouraged to reduce the demand-supply gap and to achieve sustainable development.

In fact, this trend may well even accelerate in the near future.""World oil prices have roughly halved in value since a year ago, plagued by a global supply glut caused largely by cheaper production of US oil following extraction from shale rock.Attention is now focused on Washington where the Fed will make an announcement on borrowing costs, with analyst opinion split on whether it will begin lift-off of raising rates on Thursday or wait until December.Fed chief Janet Yellen has said she expects an increase in US interest rates by the end of the year but recent turmoil in global markets caused by concerns about China´s economy have complicated policymakers´ decision-making.A rise in US interest rates tends to bolster the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand.

A result below 50 indicates shrinkage and anything above points to growth.""The decline indicates the nation´s manufacturing industry has reached a crucial stage in the structural transformation process,"" He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a statement accompanying the figures.He blamed the weakness mainly on sluggish external demand for Chinese goods and lower export prices.The figures come a day after the Asian Development Bank (ABD) said it had lowered its growth expectations for Asia because of the sharp growth slowdown in China, a key driver of global trade.""It´s a confirmation of fears that were existing in the market already that China is in fact doing worse than we had been led to believe and there´s a lot of uncertainty about where that economy really is,"" Emma Lawson, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.Among Asian stock markets Shanghai sank 0.88 percent, Hong Kong was 1.90 percent lower and Sydney -- where a number of firms with strong China links are listed -- shed 1.70 percent.Seoul, Taipei and Singapore were also each down more than one percent.

""Thanks to this agreement, Europe will also become the only region in the world which legally guarantees open internet and net neutrality,"" del Castillo told parliament in the eastern French city of Strasbourg.""The principle of net neutrality will be applied directly in the 28 member states.

In the open market, the rupee was down 30 paisa from Tuesday's closing, trading at 105.60 against the USD. Due to the rise in the value of the dollar by Rs 1.40 in the last two days, Pakistan's external debt is likely to see an increase of Rs 84 billion, analysts said. The recent climb of the dollar against the rupee has been attributed to a strong demand of the greenback from importers and its outflows from the country.

Despite the slender gains, prices are lower compared with the previous week as the market struggles with a crude oversupply and weak demand owing to sluggish global growth led by top energy guzzler China.Increasing talk of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve has also bolstered the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for weaker currencies, hurting demand and prices.A meeting last month of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hinted that a decision to implement the first rate hike since 2006 could be made during a December meeting.Comments this week by Fed chair Janet Yellen and New York Fed president Bill Dudley considered as ""hawkish"" by the market have firmed up expectations for the December FOMC meeting ""as a live possibility for the first Fed rate hike in nearly a decade,"" Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said.Markets are watching the US non-farm payrolls data to be released later Friday for further signs about the health of the US economy which could help swing any decision on interest rates, it said.The data is a closely watched gauge of the unemployment situation in the world´s biggest economy and top oil consuming nation.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in June last year.The International Monetary Fund has projected slower growth for the world economy this year and next.

267,"Singapore: Oil prices resumed their decline in Asia Wednesday, with global crude oversupply continuing to dampen investors´ sentiment despite occasional rallies.Prices had risen the previous day after a four-day losing streak, as traders weighed a bearish price outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a lowered US estimate for crude production.The oil market has collapsed by more than half since mid-2014 with prices languishing under $50 a barrel, hurt by the supply glut and the decision by the oil exporter grouping OPEC to maintain output to counter booming US shale production.The Paris-based IEA, in a report Tuesday, forecast that the global oil market would recover to $80 a barrel by 2020.At around 0300 GMT Wednesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 47 cents lower at $43.74 and Brent crude for December was down 26 cents at $47.18.""We continue to think the market will remain in surplus through most of 2016, which is likely to restrict the upside for prices, particularly over the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said in a market commentary.A strong dollar, fuelled by widening expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, has also been keeping a lid on prices.Oil is traded in the US currency and a buoyant dollar would make the commodity more expensive for those holding weaker units, lowering demand and prices.""We expect the greenback to continue to be supported as we approach the likely lift-off in rates,"" Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said, referring to a December 17 meeting of the Fed´s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

268,"Singapore: Oil prices remained under pressure in Asia Friday after a huge jump in US crude inventories reinforced projections that a supply glut will persist well into next year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was down 24 cents to $41.51 and Brent crude for December was trading four cents higher at $44.10 a barrel at around 0330 GMT.Prices were hammered Thursday after the US Department of Energy reported that commercial crude inventories in the world´s top oil consumer grew by 4.2 million barrels last week, far higher than analyst expectations of an increase of 1.3 million barrels.WTI sank 2.7 percent and Brent fell 3.8 percent after the report, which also showed US crude oil production continued to ramp higher.Global oil demand growth has not been fast enough to soak up the excess in supplies and analysts say a rebalancing of the supply-demand situation is needed for a sustained uptick in prices.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in mid-2014.""Although global oil demand growth has been exceptionally strong year-to-date, the overall pace of supply side adjustment has been too slow to end a sustained increase in global inventories that we expect to persist through most of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said.It said in a market commentary that US offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico reached its highest level since early 2010 in August and is expected to remain strong although at a slower pace into 2016 ""as several more new fields begin to produce"".Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have also kept production high in an aggressive bid to retain market share.OPEC´s collective production has stabilised at around 31.5 million barrels per day in recent months, Barclays said, but this is still more than its output ceiling of 30 million barrels per day.

269,"ANTALYA: Turkey has cancelled a multi-billion-dollar deal with China to build its first anti-missile system that had alarmed Ankaras allies in NATO, a Turkish official said on Sunday.""The deal was cancelled,"" the official from Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu´s office told AFP. ""One of the main reasons is that we will launch our own national missile project,"" added the official.The news came as Turkey hosted key Western allies including US President Barack Obama but also Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the summit of G20 top economies in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya.Turkey entered negotiations in 2013 with the China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation (CPMIEC) to finalise a contract worth $3.4 billion (3 billion euros).French-Italian consortium Eurosam and US-listed Raytheon Co had also submitted offers but the government had prioritised talks with the Chinese company, which raised serious concerns over the compatibility of CPMIEC´s systems with NATO missile defences.NATO has said missile systems within the alliance must be compatible with each other while calling on Turkey to take this factor into account.Turkish government sources said an official announcement was expected next week. A second Turkish official said the issue of technology transfer was one of the major stumbling blocks in negotiations with the Chinese company.""They refused to give what we demanded,"" the official told AFP, without elaborating. ""The talks were blocked at some point.""Although the government´s current plans to build Turkish-made missile defence system, it was not immediately clear if Ankara would launch talks with the European and American contenders.Washington was particularly irked by Turkish decision to negotiate with the Chinese company, which has been hit by a series of US sanctions for selling arms and missile technology to Iran and Pakistan.Turkey in the past made confusing comments over its lucrative tender, with a government minister saying the Chinese company was the winner and that its system could be used without integrating with NATO systems.But a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had insisted that the missile system would be harmonious and integrated with NATO defence architecture.

280,"Singapore: Oil prices held above $43 a barrel in Asia Thursday after US commercial crude supplies rose at a slower pace while jitters over the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian warplane lingered.Data from the US Department of Energy released Wednesday showed the country´s commercial crude supplies rose by 1.0 million barrels for the week ending November 20.The increase for a ninth straight week kept supplies more than 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average and further confirmed the supply glut that has depressed prices for over a year.However, analysts noted that the increase was not as much as in previous rises and could be positive for prices in the longer term.The inventories data was followed by a report from oil field services firm Baker Hughes showing US oil drilling rigs in operation fell by nine to 555, indicating an ease in activities.""US crude oil inventories are not increasing as much as before, so this is giving the market some bullish sentiment,"" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore.At around 0115 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up eight cents at $43.12 and Brent crude for January was trading seven cents higher at $46.24.Ang said a report that durable goods orders in the United States, a barometer of the health of the world´s biggest economy, came in better than expected was also helping to perk up sentiment.Prices rose after Turkey downed a Russian warplane on the Syrian border on Tuesday, due to fears that any escalation of the conflict would affect crude supplies.""There are still tensions going on and they are giving a bullish push to prices,"" Ang said.

281,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan must raise an extra $379 million (about Rs40 billion) through new tax measures, the finance minister said on Monday, as the government seeks to qualify for its latest IMF loan tranche.Earlier this month, the IMF approved the release in December of a $502 million tranche of Pakistan´s three-year $6.68 billion programme, even though the government missed targets for tax revenue generation, net domestic assets and the budget deficit.The government will levy an additional 5 to 10 percentage points of tax on 350 items and raise customs duty by 1 percentage point, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said at a press conference in the federal capital.The full list of items was not immediately available.The increased levies would target ""non-essential luxury items"" only, and exemptions on the customs duty have been offered for 25 key industrial sectors, Dar said on Monday.""We have kept in mind not to increase duties that would make items more expensive for the common man,"" he said.Separate increased taxes were also announced on imported automobiles - both new and used - and domestically-produced cigarettes.In its last review, the International Monetary Fund had warned that the release of December´s approved $502 million tranche depended on the announcement of new measures to generate an extra 40 billion Pakistan rupees ($380 million) in revenue. ""This was a deadline in a sense, and if the government didn´t do it the next tranche of the programme would at least be delayed, if not suspended,"" Khurram Husain, an economic analyst and journalist, told Reuters.It was unclear if the new measures would meet the target.Dar had earlier told a parliamentary standing committee that the increased duties were meant to restrict Pakistan´s import bill, not increase revenue.Husain said if the measures did not raise enough funds, the government would have to raise taxes on staples such as electricity and petrol.

""The port cranes are almost ready, and we are thinking that the port will be (at) full operation by the end of this year,"" said Zhang Baozhong, chairman and CEO of China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd.The Chinese company took over Gwadar´s operations in 2013. The revamped port has three multipurpose berths and its inner is dredged to 11.5 metres. ""We´re expecting at least one million tons of material will go in and out"" next year, Zhang said, speaking at a day-long conference in Gwadar city.The projected traffic represents a 100 percent increase over this year´s throughput, but is a far cry from the 300-400 million tons per year that the Gwadar Port Authority envisions for the facility, which has ambitions of becoming a regional hub.Zhang acknowledged that Gwadar now had minuscule traffic - mostly Pakistani government-subsidised fertilizer imports - but he predicted a swift transformation in coming years.Part of the problem is that the new roads that CPEC is expected to build, linking the port to China´s industrial zones, have not yet come online and the Pakistani province of Baluchistan does not have enough export-ready products.""Even if you have a very good port, (if) you don´t have an inland transporting system and the economy in the near area is not very positive, the port will not be fully utilised,"" he said.He added that his company planned to develop seafood processing plants and other facilities in a 923 hectare free zone outside the port.

459,"WASHINGTON: Japan´s extraordinarily easy monetary policy, a source of friction with the United States for pushing the yen´s value down, has had some positive effects on emerging Asian economies, including increased growth and equity prices, International Monetary Fund researchers have found.The IMF findings were released in a paper on Friday, as Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in Japan, where divergent views on Japan´s monetary policy and currency market interventions were expected to be a hot topic.The paper claims to be the first to model the spillover effects of Japan´s qualitative and quantitative easing program (QQE) on Southeast Asian countries.QQE was launched in 2013 and targets both government bond purchases as well as other assets, such as exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.The program has helped push down the yen from 82 to the dollar in 2012 to 119 to the dollar by August 2015. Japanese equity prices surged and inflation also strengthened during this period.Despite Southeast Asian currencies rising against the yen, they mirrored some of these effects, study authors GiovanniGanelli, and Nour Tawk said. ""Our results show that implementation of QQE in Japan, when estimated by a positive shock to Japanese equity prices, consistently caused an increase in equity prices across emerging Asian countries, as well as an appreciation of their currencies,"" they wrote.""Most (Southeast Asian) countries experienced an increase in output and a temporary increase in inflation. Capital inflows surged in many countries.""They argue that while most existing research uses interest rate changes as proxies for quantitative easing, this transmission channel is broken in Japan because rates have been at the zero bound for an extended period.Instead, they use stock market surges and increases in the monetary base as proxies for QQE.The researchers said that Japan´s QQE caused a significant increase in equity prices in emerging Asia, with increases in the 2 to 5 percent range for China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.And while nearly all countries surveyed experienced an appreciation of their currencies versus the yen as a result of QQE, it had a ""generally positive"" impact on growth in emerging Asian countries, with statistically significant increases in<br/> Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.",5/21/2016,IMF researchers say Japan monetary easing has benefits for Asian economi,business,"['WASHINGTON', 'Japan´s', 'United', 'States', 'Asian', 'International', 'Monetary', 'Fund', 'IMF', 'Group', 'of', 'Seven', 'Japan', 'Japan´s', 'Japan´s', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'Japanese', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'GiovanniGanelli', 'Nour', 'Tawk', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'Asian', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'Japan', 'Japan´s', 'Asia', 'China', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia', 'Asian', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Philippines', 'Thailand']","['I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC']"

And we all know where that ends up: higher prices in the shops,"" Cameron wrote in the Sun on Sunday newspaper.The warning comes from a government analysis of the short-term impact that a British exit would have on voters.He said the average family's weekly food and drink bill would rise by almost 3 percent, or 120 pounds ($174.06) per year, and that clothing and footwear costs would rise by 5 percent, or 100 pounds per year.The 'rival 'Out' campaign disputed the analysis. ""The EU pushes up the prices in our supermarkets because of its protectionist policies. That's ok for big business fat cats but it's not good for British families,' said Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott.Six out of the last seven polls published in the last week have shown the Remain campaign in the lead, and on Saturday two major bookmakers offered the shortest odds to date on a vote to remain.On Friday Osborne warned, citing the same Treasury analysis, said house prices would fall if Britain left the EU.

475,"The advent of mobile and smartphone technology has transformed the dynamics of communication in Pakistan. The adoption rates for smartphones are growing rapidly in both urban and rural centers. In 2015, 31% of mobiles purchased in the country were smartphones. Pakistan has approximately 80% mobile user penetration. These mobile phones have become so common that they are not considered a luxury device anymore but rather, an item of necessity. This technology has the potential to solve various day-to-day problems and the ability to lift people out of poverty. In fact, in the life of every individual, a mobile phone plays a critical role.   The reason behind a common man owning a phone can be attributed to price affordability and availability of quality smartphones within the reach of the masses. There are some big names is Pakistans smartphone market, but the role which Q Mobile has played for equipping the masses with mobile and smartphones has to be applauded. Q Mobile, which is the largest smartphone brand in Pakistan and enjoys a lion's share in the smartphone market, provides various kinds of phones such as smartphones, feature phones and tablets. It is clearly evident that, from a shopkeeper to a businessman, Q Mobile serves all Socio - Economic Classes.Once upon a time, these phones were used to send a message or receive a call but now, with all telecom operators providing affordable data services, the use of smartphones takes a completely new level of information.We now have access to mobile payment solutions, where we can send or receive money from distant areas within a fraction of seconds. We can shop online and pay via our mobile phones, connect with our loved ones living abroad via video calling, social networking and staying ever connected with all the news from around the world.Very soon, our farmers will check the daily commodity rate or inquire about delivery to the market. Long distance route truck drivers, who transport goods, can use online maps and GPS to plan their routes. Traders in the rural areas can narrow the gap with their buyers and sellers in urban areas by using mobile broadband. Health related services are also available via smartphones. A recent study by the Santa Fe Institute theorizes that cell phone use could help developing countries plan electrical infrastructure.With so much developments taking place, smartphones clearly represent a growing segment of our economy and are an example of how the availability of technology can propel Pakistan in the global marketplace while improving the lives of a common man at the same time.",5/29/2016,Mobile phones Step towards a connected futur,business,"['Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistans', 'Q', 'Mobile', 'Q', 'Mobile', 'Pakistan', 'Q', 'Mobile', '-', 'Pakistan']","['I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC']"

In Asian afternoon trade it was at $1.3387.""Leave´s victory has delivered one of the biggest market shocks of all time,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. ""The reverberations of the vote will be felt around the world.""The extent of the damage on asset prices is hard to gauge but it´s likely to be bigger than anything since Lehmans at the very least,"" he added, referring to the Wall Street bank whose collapsed precipitated the global financial crisis.The dollar slumped briefly to 99.02 yen, the first time it has gone below 100 yen since November 2013, before edging back up above 101 yen. The Japanese unit is considered a safe bet in times of uncertainty and turmoil.The Bank of Japan said Friday it was ready to work with other central banks to pump cash into financial markets to combat wild swings, while the Bank of England said it would take ""all necessary steps"" to avert a full-blown crisis.Earlier Japan´s Finance Minister Taro Aso vowed a ""firm response"" to volatility if necessary.

It was dealt further blows in July when a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on July 14 in the Riviera city of Nice. Two weeks later, two men killed a priest in a small town in Normandy. Strikes against a controversial labour reform and floods in June also deterred tourists.Nightly hotel stays were down 8.5 percent in the Paris-Ile de-France region in the first half, with an 11.5 percent decline for foreign tourists and a 4.8 percent drop for French tourists.Japanese visitors were down 46.2 percent in the first half compared with the same period in 2015, while Russians were down 35 percent, Chinese down 19.6 percent, and Americans down 5.7 percent, the Paris region tourist board statement said.France is the most-visited country in the world, with almost 85 million foreigners last year, including 16 million in Paris.Weak activity in France contributed to a fall in first-half operating profit for French group AccorHotels.

""Weaker oil prices are likely to weigh on the sector, with investor appetite remaining weak.""Gains in crude prices could also be capped by rising crude exports from Libya after the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Tuesday it would immediately start working to resume crude exports from ports seized in recent days by forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar.Libyan production could be raised to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) from about 290,000 bpd within a month, further adding to the global crude supply glut.",9/14/2016,Oil rises on smaller than expected build in US crude ,business,"['SINGAPORE', 'Asian', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'American', 'Petroleum', 'Institute', 'API', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'Brent', 'LCOc1', 'GMT', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'West', 'Texas', 'Intermediate', 'CLc1', 'International', 'Energy', 'Agency', 'IEA', 'EIA', 'Australian', 'ANZ', 'Libya', 'National', 'Oil', 'Corporation', 'NOC', 'Khalifa', 'Haftar', 'Libyan']","['I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC']"

712,"strong>ANKARA: The number of foreigners visiting Turkey plummeted nearly 38 percent in August, with tourism battered by the July failed coup and security concerns after attacks, statistics showed Thursday.</strongThe figures are the first to show visitor numbers for a full month after the attempted putsch which saw a rogue military faction try to oust President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from power and attempt to seize Istanbul´s main international airport.Some 3.18 million visitors came to Turkey in August this year, down 37.96 percent on August 2015, the tourism ministry said in its latest release.June saw the sharpest drop of 40.86 percent compared with the previous year, while in July, the number of arrivals fell by 36.72 percent.The tourism industry had already been hit before the coup by a string of attacks this year including the triple suicide bombing at Istanbul´s main airport in June which left 47 dead and was blamed on the Islamic State group.Last month, 57 people including 34 children were killed in a suicide bombing during a Kurdish wedding in the southern city of Gaziantep. IS was again blamed by Turkish authorities.The tourism industry last year was worth $35.1 billion in revenues and it accounts for 4.4 percent of GDP in Turkey.Despite normalising ties with Moscow in June and the lifting of travel sanctions this summer, visitor numbers to Turkey from Russia fell 83.63 percent last month compared with the previous year.In August 2015, the overall number of Russian visitors was nearly 640,000 but this year´s figure for August was under 105,000, in a devastating blow to tourism on Turkey´s Mediterranean coast.However, the resumption of charter flights to Turkish resorts at the start of September could see a welcome rise in Russian visitors.Arrivals in August from the key tourism market of Germany were down 34.5 percent while arrivals from Iran -- an increasing source of tourism -- fell almost 32 percent.Saudi Arabia was the only key tourism market to see any growth with visitor numbers from the kingdom reversing the trend and doubling in August 2015.In its latest trading update Tuesday, British travel operator Thomas Cook Group said that there was strong demand for most destinations except Turkey.The operator saw a four percent slump in bookings because of Turkey where ""demand continues to be volatile"", Peter Fankhauser, the group´s chief executive, said in a statement.",9/29/2016,Turkey suffers 38 visitor drop coup hits touri,business,"['ANKARA', 'Turkey', 'Recep', 'Tayyip', 'Erdogan', 'Istanbul´s', 'Turkey', 'Istanbul´s', 'Islamic', 'State', 'Kurdish', 'Gaziantep', 'IS', 'Turkish', 'Turkey', 'Moscow', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Russian', 'Turkey´s', 'Mediterranean', 'Turkish', 'Russian', 'Germany', 'Iran', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'British', 'Thomas', 'Cook', 'Group', 'Turkey', 'Turkey', 'Peter', 'Fankhauser']","['I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG']"

718,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices surged Thursday after the OPEC producers´ group surprised the market with a deal to slash output.</strongAt the end of six hours of negotiations and weeks of horse trading, OPEC announced the plan to cut production to a level of 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd) from 33.47 billion, bpd in August, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.The informal meeting was held on the sidelines of an IEA meeting in a bid to stabilise prices that have been battered by a stubborn supply glut since 2014.Oil prices soared by as much as six percent following the news and extended gains in Asian trade on Thursday although at a slower pace.At around 0100 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in November was up 23 cents to $47.29 and Brent crude for November added 22 cents to $48.91 a barrel.The decision to cut output caught the market offguard.Market watchers had been pessimistic about a cut or a freeze after similar efforts fell apart in April due to disagreements between OPEC majors Saudi Arabia and Iran.Angus Nicholson, a Melbourne-based analyst with IG Markets said the OPEC decision was the main impetus for the price surge but said details of the deal ""sound a bit fuzzy at the moment"".""There is the possibility that OPEC managed to commit to a weak deal at this meeting that may pave the way for a more comprehensive production cut at the November meeting,"" he said in a note, referring to OPEC´s formal meeting on November 30.""A more comprehensive deal from OPEC and Russia at the November meeting would easily clear the way for WTI oil to trade around US$55.""Nicholson also said official data showing a fall in the weekly US commercial crude inventories helped to boost the market.The US Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude stocks in the world´s top oil consumer fell by 1.9 million barrels, confounding expectations for a rise of three million barrels.A decline in crude stocks signals stronger consumption and is positive for oil prices.""This has now been four straight weeks of back-to-back declines in crude oil inventories, which is also very supportive of the spot price,"" Nicholson said.",9/29/2016,Oil prices surge after OPECs surprise output cut d,business,"['SINGAPORE', 'OPEC', 'OPEC', 'International', 'Energy', 'Agency', 'IEA', 'IEA', 'Asian', 'GMT', 'US', 'West', 'Texas', 'Intermediate', 'WTI', 'Brent', 'OPEC', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Iran', 'Angus', 'Nicholson', 'Melbourne', '-', 'based', 'IG', 'Markets', 'OPEC', 'OPEC', 'OPEC´s', 'OPEC', 'Russia', 'WTI', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'Energy', 'Administration']","['I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG']"

He reviewed the umpire´s decision but technology showed a snick to the delight of home supporters after Root had dominated the second day with his unbeaten century.Moeen Ali (19) dispatched three lusty boundaries in a quick appearance at the wicket before edging a delivery from Chris Morris that saw wicketkeeper Dane Vilas pull off a stunning diving catch. Rabada then bowled Broad with a fullish delivery for 12 as England edged towards South Africa´s score.Steven Finn got the slightest touch off his gloves to a rising delivery from Morne Morkel and was caught behind without scoring.

That would mean Blatter would have been paid for nearly five months during which time he was unable to carry out his duties, and a period in which FIFA has appointed an acting president, African soccer head Issa Hayatou.The compensation sub-committee of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee recently ruled that it could stop Blatter's bonuses but not, according to his contract, his salary.""Until the election of a new president on February 26, Mr Blatter is the elected president and therefore - according to his contract - is entitled to receive his remuneration,"" Bantel said.Blatter's U.S. lawyer and his Switzerland-based spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.FIFA is facing the worst corruption crisis in it history as a total of 41 individuals and entities, including many former FIFA officials, have been charged with corruption-related offences in the United States. The U.S. investigation is far from over and FIFA also faces a parallel Swiss probe.Blatter's bonuses have been stopped because he was not carrying out his duties of supervising the organization, including its general secretary.Only last week, FIFA announced that Jerome Valcke was fired from his position as general secretary.

779,"PRETORIA:  Stephen Cook became the 100th batsman to score a debut Test century and his innings of 115 helped South Africa amass 329 for five on the first day of the final Test against England on Friday in their bid to salvage pride in a lost series.Hashim Amla scored his 25th Test century as he and Cook shared a second-wicket stand of 202 but captain AB de Villiers departed second ball on a day of contrasting fortunes as England, 2-0 up in the four-Test series, fought back to claim four wickets after tea.Temba Bavuma (32) and Quinton de Kock (25) were not out at the close of play at Centurion Park.Handed his debut at the age of 33, one of five South Africa changes from the team badly beaten in the third Test in Johannesburg last week, Cook brought his domestic form to the test arena with a dream start to his international career.He survived two dropped catches, two close run-out calls and an lbw appeal unsuccessfully reviewed by England before reaching three figures -- a nervous spell in the 90s exacerbated by the departures of Amla and De Villiers.But Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball on his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, looked organised from the start, hitting a four off the first ball of the match when James Anderson´s delivery strayed down leg side.He should have been out on 47 but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broad´s bowling. He was eventually bowled after an innings of 187 balls when he got an inside edge to a delivery from Chris Woakes.Amla, who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting, looked effortless as he raced to three figures, scoring 109 off 168 balls with 19 boundaries before he played on to Ben Stokes.De Villiers, captain for his second Test, was out for his second duck in successive innings, caught at second slip by Joe Root off Broad.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg dismissed Dean Elgar for 20 for the first wicket of the day as the short leg fielder continued a run of spectacular dismissals in the series.JP Duminy was Moeen Ali´s second wicket, trapped lbw for 16 -- the last wicket of the day as England checked South Africa´s progress after they had look poised for a huge total on 237 for one.

But Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he made his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, looked organised at the crease as he brought to the Test arena his dominant form in domestic competition.He hit a four off the first ball of the match when James Anderson´s delivery strayed down leg side.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg was the only positive moment of the day for England as Dean Elgar was dismissed for 20 in unusual circumstances before lunch.Taylor showed a sharp presence of mind to grasp a catch after Elgar´s stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf, allowing him to snatch it up before it dropped to the ground.Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali, hitting with some power, and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review of the television evidence by the third umpire.It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor, thriving in the most dangerous position on the field.South Africa won the toss and had no hesitation in electing to take first use of a good batting wicket.Their advantage was increased by a poor England bowling display with too many balls drifting down the leg-side or pitched too short.

790,"MELBOURNE: Anna-Lena Friedsam´s giant-killing run at the Australian Open ended in tears and injury on Sunday when ailments to both legs allowed world number four Agnieszka Radwanska to snatch a 6-7 (6) 6-1 7-5 fourth round win.The 21-year-old German, who had never been past the second round of a grand slam before this year´s tournament, had Radwanska on the ropes when she led 5-2 in the deciding set before injury cruelly struck at 5-4.The 82nd-ranked Friedsam, who beat U.S. Open finalist Roberta Vinci in the third round, then took an injury time out and had strapping applied to her left leg.Radwanska held serve in the next game, but Friedsam appeared to exacerbate her injury.The German was given a time warning on the first point of the next game when she was unable to serve and broke into tears.She managed to play on and was 15-40 down when she appeared to strain her right hamstring.Chair umpire Felix Torralba then sanctioned her again for exceeding the time limit and awarded Radwanska a point that sealed the game and gave her a 6-5 advantage.The trainer again visited Friedman, who was in constant tears on her chair, but she managed to hobble out and complete the match and was given a massive cheer by the Hisense Arena crowd for her efforts.Radwanska will now meet Spain´s Carla Suarez-Navarro, who beat Australia´s Daria Gavrilova 0-6 6-3 6-2, in the last eight.The Pole, who had to play through the pain of a leg injury in the third round, said she had felt a twinge of sympathy for her hobbled opponent but also needed to be ruthless to advance.""Of course, it´s hard to see that,"" said Radwanska, a semi-finalist at Melbourne Park in 2014.""It´s tough because you know someone is struggling.

791,"PRETORIA: South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada struck three times shortly before lunch to leave England teetering on 211 for six wickets on the third day of the fourth Test at Centurion Park on Sunday.Rabada removed England´s rock Joe Root (76), James Taylor (14) and Jonny Bairstow (0) with the tourists trailing by 264 runs after South Africa posted a first innings total of 475 on a wicket that is starting to favour the bowlers.In-form Ben Stokes (one) and Moeen Ali (zero) will seek to repair the damage after the interval with the first target to score the 65 runs required to avoid the follow-on.Rabada went to the interval with figures of 5-76, another sign of the rich potential of the 20-year-old who got movement at pace off the wicket to leave his side in control.Captain Alastair Cook (76) was the first wicket to fall in the opening session of the day when he was caught behind by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock off the bowling of tall fast bowler Morne Morkel.Coming around the wicket to the left-hander, Morkel angled the ball into Cook´s body and induced an edge as it moved away slightly off the wicket.It left Cook still 41 runs shy of becoming the first England batsman to reach 10,000 test runs after he had put on 99 for the third wicket with Root.Root and Taylor moved the score on to 208 before the former was caught by De Kock having a drive at Rabada after he had brought up his fourth half-century of the series.That wicket started a precession in the minutes before lunch as Taylor fell to the same combination trying to pull a short ball.South Africa´s successful morning was complete when Bairstow got a feather edge through to De Kock as a rampant Rabada tore through the middle-order.

792,"PRETORIA: Firebrand fast bowler Kagiso Rabada bagged two wickets as South Africa reduced England to 52 for three at the close of day four of the final Test on Monday.The tourists, who have already won the series, need a further 330 for what would be a record-breaking victory on the final day but must do so on a wicket showing variable bounce and prodigious turn at Centurion Park.England´s hopes of an unlikely victory or survival will rest on Joe Root (19 not out) who is at the crease with James Taylor (19 not out) after Rabada gave the hosts the perfect start.The 20-year-old forced another failure from opener Alex Hales who was trapped lbw for one by a ball that kept low and jagged into him.Rabada claimed his ninth wicket of the match when he had Nick Compton (six) caught behind, the England batsman unsuccessfully reviewing what seemed an obvious edge.With a tense final day likely, England will hope that wasted review does not come back to haunt them.In between, Morne Morkel grabbed the prize scalp of England captain Alastair Cook (five) with a brilliant one-handed caught and bowled to leave the latter still 36 runs short of 10,000 test runs after a poor series.South Africa should have celebrated the wicket of Root as well, but wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock failed to take the ball after spinner Dane Piedt had drawn the batsman from his crease and beaten the edge.South Africa earlier declared their second innings on 248 for five.Hashim Amla fell four short of a second century in the match when he uncharacteristically flashed wildly at a wide deliver from Stuart Broad in the pursuit of quick runs.Amla added 117 for the fifth wicket with Temba Bavuma (78 not out), who showed great application and maturity.The highest successful chase in test matches at Centurion Park is 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Thunderstorms are forecast in Pretoria on Tuesday, though those will likely come late in the afternoon.

793,"MELBOURNE -- A year after her finest Grand Slam to date, Madison Keys left this year's Australian Open in tears.Playing on an injured left leg, Keys fell to Zhang Shuai 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth round in Melbourne.In the second set, Keys began hobbling noticeably and called for treatment. She was unable to engage in long rallies and grimaced between points.With speculation she might retire, No. 15 Keys returned to the court, but the pain only seemed to increase. Already down a break, Keys doubled-faulted two times in a row, handing her Chinese opponent the set.Keys limped to her changeover chair, understandably frustrated, but this time did not call a trainer.Somehow, she managed to go up an early break at 2-1 in the third on a crushing 91 mph forehand return but was immediately broken back.After a quick hold from Zhang, a qualifier, Keys took another medical timeout. In the next game, she was visibly crying in pain. At that point, Keys could hardly move, lunging at shots just out of her reach.Zhang, 27, ultimately pulled away, ending the match on an overcooked forehand from Keys. The American hobbled off the court, her face in a towel, distraught at the outcome.More than an hour after her three-set loss, Keys gingerly walked to an area adjacent to the women's locker room with the assistance of her publicist.Keys, too injured to make the longer jaunt to the main interview roof, expressed her disappointment.In her last round, Keys strained an abdominal muscle, an injury she said also bothered her against Zhang.Amazingly, the 133rd-ranked Zhang had never advanced past the first round of a major in 14 previous attempts. ",1/25/2016,Keys falls to Zhang Shuai at Australian O,sports,"['Grand', 'Slam', 'Madison', 'Keys', 'Australian', 'Open', 'Keys', 'Zhang', 'Shuai', 'Melbourne', 'Keys', 'Keys', 'Keys', 'Chinese', 'Keys', 'Zhang', 'Keys', 'Keys', 'Zhang', 'Keys', 'American', 'Keys', 'Keys', 'Keys', 'Zhang', 'Zhang']","['I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER']"
794,"MELBOURNE: Milos Raonic struck a blow for the next generation of men´s tennis by flooring former champion Stan Wawrinka on Monday to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals.Second seed Andy Murray, returning to court two days after his father-in-law was rushed to hospital, hit back for the old guard in the evening session at Rod Laver Arena though, banishing Bernard Tomic, the last home hope in the singles.Murray´s win capped a banner day for Britain following Johanna Konta´s advance, giving the nation men´s and women´s singles quarter-finalists at the same grand slam for the first time in nearly 40 years.Melbourne Park was rocked by corruption allegations on its opening day, and a week later, integrity fears returned as a former Australian professional player pleaded guilty to match-fixing at a Sydney court.Former world number 187 Nick Lindahl appeared in court just hours after a top global bookmaker suspended betting after heavy gambling on a mixed doubles match at Melbourne Park.The winning doubles pair dismissed suspicions over the match after being questioned by integrity officials. There was no questioning the commitment of Raonic and Wawrinka as the pair slugged out a three-hour 44-minute thriller in the day session on Rod Laver Arena.Long seen as a threat to the Novak Djokovic-led establishment, 25-year-old Raonic showed ice in his veins to fend off the 2014 champion 6-4 6-3 5-7 4-6 6-3 after the 30-year-old Swiss roared back from two sets down.Unveiling an aggressive serve-volley game, Raonic fired 82 winners past the fourth seed to set up a second successive quarter-final at Melbourne Park.Having lost to Djokovic a year ago, he will be favourite against French showman Gael Monfils who delighted fans with some spectacular dives as he beat Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 7-5 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.Raonic is on an eight-match winning streak since the start of the year, a run which included upsetting Roger Federer to win the Brisbane International, and he credits new coach Carlos Moya for giving him confidence to stray from the baseline.""He´s sort of organising my strengths, my weapons and how to use them better,"" the 13th seed told reporters.

795,"MELBOURNE: Second seed Andy Murray had his feathers ruffled but scrapped his way into the Australian Open quarter-finals with a 6-4 6-4 7-6(4) victory over local hope Bernard Tomic on Monday.The Briton, four-times a runner-up at Melbourne Park, was close to exasperation after being broken four times by the unorthodox Australian world number 17 but dug deep when it mattered to reach the last eight for the seventh year in a row.Murray had endured a tricky couple of days since Nigel Sears, the father of his pregnant wife Kim, collapsed in the stands on Rod Laver Arena and was taken to hospital while the Scot was playing his third round tie on Margaret Court Arena.As Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic, has since been discharged and cleared to join his daughter in England, Murray hoped he would have a calmer preparation for his quarter-final encounter with Spanish eighth seed David Ferrer.Murray, 28, enjoyed success with the drop shot early in the match but that started to wane in a match that was always interesting if never turning into a real contest.Tomic, 23, showed flashes of the quality that has had Australia raving about his potential since his early teens but was unable to maintain the level of his performance for sufficiently long periods to cause an upset.Murray, who fired 18 aces and 43 winners, clinched a topsy turvy third set in the tiebreak when Tomic went long with a return after two and a half hours on court.""I just felt I was very uncomfortable,"" Tomic, who dropped serve three times in the first set, said.""While on paper it looked like a close match it was uncomfortable for me.<br/> I didn´t play the game the way I wanted to but he didn´t let me.""After Johanna Konta earlier earned her place in the quarter-finals, Murray´s victory means Britain will have a presence in the last eight of both draws of a grand slam for the first time since the 1977 Australian Open.Murray has his eye firmly fixed on becoming Britain´s first men´s champion in Australia since Fred Perry in 1934 but he must get past Ferrer to do it.

The hosts led by 356 runs on a pitch that has turn, movement and uneven bounce.The pair have put on 117 for the fifth wicket and kept England wicketless between lunch and tea after the touring side had made good inroads in the opening session when a fired-up James Anderson grabbed two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.South Africa, who are likely to be down to three front-line bowlers in the second innings with seamer Kyle Abbott struggling due to a hamstring problem, must decide what target they want to set England with four sessions remaining.They will be mindful of overworking their depleted attack as they chase a consolation victory in the test with England already having claimed the series.The previous highest chase successful in Test matches at Centurion Park was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Anderson had earlier taken his number of test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw without scoring.It was the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in Test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.Stokes removed JP Duminy (29) caught behind by Bairstow to leave South Africa sweating at 106 for four, before Amla and Bavuma edged the home side ahead again.

Mitchell Santner bowled just two balls and took the last two wickets.Martin Guptill top scored for New Zealand with 90, his highest total against Australia and his 29th one-day international half century.The 29-year-old opener, who hit one of his five sixes onto the roof of the stand at the Auckland venue, shared in partnerships of 79 runs with captain Brendon McCullum (44) and 100 with Henry Nicholls (61).New Zealand, who were asked to bat by Australia captain Steve Smith, had initially looked on course to set a total well in excess of 320 but lost wickets at critical times when batsmen looked set to push on.John Hastings was the most economical of the visiting bowlers with 1-39 from 10 overs, while fifth seamer Mitchell Marsh had figures of 2-35 from seven.The three-match one-day international series moves on to Wellington on Saturday with the sides also scheduled to play two Tests.

He dismissed Babar Azam for a duck in his first over, Umar Amin for four in his second and then got the big wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq for 12 as Islamabad lost half their side for 66 runs. Shane Watson, who made 28, was their top-scorer, but he was dismissed by Wahab in the ninth over.Sam Billings and Andre Russell resisted, but both of them fell off successive balls and Wahab finished with 3 for 32. Asghar had a hand in those wickets too - he clung on to two sharp chances on the cover boundary and later played them down by saying he had large hands like most Pathans and so it would be hard to drop catches. So United fell to 121 for 9 and their second defeat in as many matches.In the first innings, Peshawar managed to reach 145 with Tamim Iqbal making a run-a-ball half-century. It ended up a crucial contribution considering Peshawar, having chosen to bat, had stumbled to 88 for 4 in the 15th over and needed a set batsman in the middle for Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy to go hard at the other end.

851,"CENTURION: Joe Roots highest ODI score has left South Africa requiring a record chase if they are to avoid conceding a series-deciding defeat at the hands of England.Root's 125, the highest ODI score made by an England batsman against South Africa, has left the hosts needing to make the highest successful chase in an ODI at Centurion. West Indies' 300 for three, scored in 2004, is the record to date.In these days of great expectations of ODI scores, England's total of 318 for eight may not seem particularly extravagant. But on a cracked, two-paced pitch that challenges batsmen with uneven bounce, it is likely to prove a challenging target.South Africa lost the first two ODIs of the five-match series and are in danger of conceding defeat in the Test and ODI series to the same opposition during a home tour for the first time in 14 years.By the time South Africa struck for the fourth time, they could have been quietly satisfied with their work. Jos Buttler, again promoted to No. 4 to build upon the strong start from England's top order, had fallen first ball clipping to an intriguingly placed leg gully, while Eoin Morgan had laboured for 24 deliveries over his eight runs.But then Ben Stokes joined Root in a fifth-wicket stand of 82 in eight overs that took England's total from the average to the strong. ",2/9/2016,Root ton helps England reach 318 8,sports,"['Joe', 'Roots', 'ODI', 'South', 'Africa', 'England', 'Root', 'ODI', 'England', 'South', 'Africa', 'Centurion', 'West', 'Indies', 'ODI', 'England', 'South', 'Africa', 'Test', 'ODI', 'South', 'Africa', 'Jos', 'Buttler', 'England', 'Eoin', 'Morgan', 'Ben', 'Stokes', 'Root', 'England']","['I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC']"

Both those events will be held in England.Broad enjoyed an excellent Test on this ground less than a month ago, where he claimed 6 for 17 in the second innings to help England secure the series.He may find conditions less helpful this time, though. There is a painfully short boundary on one side of the ground and the pitch appears to lack the cracks he exploited so well during the Test.Broad replaces David Willey in the side for this match, while Chris Woakes, who was also omitted from the World T20 squad, returns to the England side in place of Chris Jordan, who has taken one wicket in 17.3 overs in the series, at an average of 143 and an economy rate of 8.17.

935,"CHRISTCHURCH: Joe Burns and Usman Khawaja reduced Australia´s victory target to 131 runs with nine wickets in hand at the end of the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand at Hagley Oval on Tuesday.Burns was on 27, while Khawaja was 19 not out with Australia 70 for one after being set 201 runs to win the match and series 2-0.They had earlier dismissed the hosts in their second innings for 335 after tea.David Warner was the only wicket to fall when he was caught down the leg side by BJ Watling from Neil Wagner for 22, though New Zealand needed to ask for a review to determine the ball had glanced his gloves.Jackson Bird grabbed his first five-wicket haul to help wrap up New Zealand´s second innings after tea that had been characterised by stubborn middle and lower-order resistance.Bird, who had grabbed three quick wickets after lunch, including the key scalp of Kane Williamson (97), bowled Matt Henry for 66 -- his first half century and highest score -- then had Trent Boult caught for a duck to finish with 5-59.James Pattinson finished with 4-77, but had the most important wicket in the final session on Tuesday when he dismissed Watling for 46 after the wicketkeeper had combined with Henry in a crucial 118-run partnership.Until their eighth-wicket stand, the hosts had been in danger of being dismissed with a lead of only about 100 after Bird had broken a 102-run partnership between Williamson and Corey Anderson (40) that had got their side into credit.The pair batted through a heated first session in which Australia dropped two catches, had two reviews turned down and an lbw decision overturned.The second review, just before lunch and against Williamson, prompted a petulant outburst from captain Steve Smith and Josh Hazlewood, with the tall fast bowler likely to face further sanctions after microphones picked up his expletive-laden rant.New Zealand had begun the day on 121 for four, 14 runs in arrears of Australia´s 505, but their stubborn resistance ensured the match would enter a fifth and final day.The target also appeared competitive though not overly challenging on a good batting surface and Australia should seal victory to reclaim the number one ranking in Test cricket, though Anderson said his side would make it tough for the visitors.

951,"DHAKA: World crickets most intriguing rivalry will once again be renewed when India take on an unpredictable Pakistan with rehabilitated pacer Mohammed Amir being the focus of attention in a round robin league encounter of the Asia Cup T20 tournament here today (Saturday).The match will also serve as a pre cursor to the two teams opening round battle in the ICC World Twenty20 next month.The Indo Pak cricket contests over the years have carried a legacy not to forget the political undercurrents involved whenever the two bitter neighbours square off on the 22 yards.But the most exciting aspect will be whether the tainted Amir gets to play in the XI.Back after serving a five year ban for spot fixing Amir has started playing for the national team since the tour of New Zealand and this immensely talented bowler will certainly come out all guns blazing against the Indian batsmen.Virat Kohli has already welcomed Amir s return but not much is known as to what other Indian players including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni think about the convicted spot  fixer s inclusion.In India, the BCCI has taken a zero tolerance approach imposing life bans on players like S Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan, Ajit Chandila who have no hopes of returning to competitive cricket.For Amir, though a good performance against India will probably help him gain some credibility not only in the dressing room but also among the common cricket loving public in Pakistan.In terms of preparation, both teams have been suitably prepared considering the amount of Twenty20 cricket they have played in the past one month.India already kicked off their World T20 preparations in style having won six out of the seven games played so far.Pakistan cricketers on the other hand are coming straight after playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) which keeps them well prepared.Traditionally, India have never ever lost to Pakistan in the global events but it has not been the case in the continental event where Shahid Afridi and co have performed well.However the Asia Cup has never been played in the T20 format which is also a first.

""I have strong, dear thoughts for Mr Michel Platini right now.""Only the ninth president in FIFA's 112-year history, he inherits a very different job from that enjoyed by Blatter, who toured the world for 17 years like a head of state, dispensing development funds to his global support base.Before the election, the Congress had overwhelmingly passed a set of reforms intended to make FIFA more transparent, professional and accountable.That package should mean the new president faces much closer scrutiny than Blatter did -- his salary will be published for the first time -- and have less influence over the day-to-day management of the organisation's business affairs.",2/27/2016,Infantino chosen to lead FIFA into new er,sports,"['ZURICH', 'Gianni', 'Infantino', 'FIFA', 'UEFA', 'Swiss', 'Sepp', 'Blatter', 'FIFA', 'FIFA', 'Europe', 'FIFA', 'Congress', 'Zurich', 'Asian', 'Football', 'Confederation', 'Sheikh', 'Salman', 'bin', 'Ebrahim', 'Al', 'Khalifa', 'Bahrain', 'Infantino', 'Prince', 'Ali', 'Jerome', 'Champagne', 'European', 'Asia', 'Infantino', 'Europe', 'UEFA', 'Michel', 'Platini', 'Blatter', 'Michel', 'Platini', 'Infantino', 'Michel', 'Platini', 'FIFA', 'Blatter', 'Congress', 'FIFA', 'Blatter']","['I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER']"

964,"DUBAI: Stan Wawrinka edged out Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in a nerve-jangling, near-30 minute tiebreak to secure the Dubai Duty Free Championship with a 6-4 7-6(13) triumph on Saturday.Wawrinka´s path to victory had been eased by the retirements of world number one Novak Djokovic and Australian prospect Nick Kyrgios in the earlier rounds but the Swiss often toiled against surprise finalist Baghdatis, whom he beat for a sixth successive time.World number four Wawrinka was gifted the first set by a Baghdatis double fault -- his third of that game alone -- and a tepid second set was notable for not featuring a single break point.But then followed a 28-point tiebreak in which twice grand slam champion Wawrinka saved five set points before a Baghdatis backhand drifted long to give the Swiss a second title of the year following his victory in Chennai in January.Baghdatis initially played serve and volley with aplomb, while Wawrinka´s stinging backhand was lethal from the baseline, but that early assurance proved fleeting as both players made a catalogue of errors.Wawrinka afforded Baghdatis two break points after whipping a forehand wide and the Cypriot converted following another wayward Swiss forehand for a 3-2 first-set lead.Wawrinka, who was within two points of suffering opening-round elimination at the Aviation Club, immediately broke back with a crosscourt winner past the advancing Baghdatis, who was seeking a first title since 2010.The pair were content to trade half-paced shots from the back of the court and when either did up the tempo it usually failed.World number 57 Baghdatis, serving at 4-5, saved four set points but his serve deserted him again as he conceded the set.The second set went with serve before an attritional tiebreak in which Baghdatis fluffed chances to square the match and Wawrinka threw his racket in frustration after missing an easy forehand.

First, Chetty (55) and Mignon du Preez (43) added 72 for the second wicket, before Marizanne Kapp (39) and van Niekerk provided the innings late impetus by stringing together a 64-run fifth-wicket stand. Van Niekerk slammed 55 off 48 balls before being run out.West Indies, in reply, lost their opener Hayley Matthews early in the chase, but Shaquana Quintyne and Kyshona Knight led a recovery with a 57-run partnership for the second wicket.

Because it involves the security of our players, officials, people and media who will go to India for the event, sportskeeda.com quoted Mani as saying.Comparing the situation with Australias boycott of the 2016 Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, Mani quipped: If this match had involved the Australian team I am sure by now they would have pulled out of the match.They made their position on security for their players clear when they pulled out of the ICC Youth World Cup in Bangladesh earlier this year.Mani was also of the opinion that the PCB needed to make their stand on not playing in Dharamsala crystal clear.Talking about Pakistans attempt to re-establish Indo-Pakistan cricket relations Mani said: The Pakistan government has also shown it believes in having cricketing relations with India but I would think playing in Dharamsala in this environment would be risky for the Pakistan team.Meanwhile talks about an alternate venue have started to do the rounds however no decision has been made on this yet.  ",3/2/2016,Mani wants PCB to pull out of their World T20 match against Indi,sports,"['ISLAMABAD', 'International', 'Cricket', 'Council', 'ICC', 'Ehsan', 'Mani', 'Pakistan', 'Cricket', 'Board', 'PCB', 'World', 'Twenty20', 'India', 'Dharamsala', 'Himachal', 'Pardesh', 'Virbhadra', 'Singh', 'Pakistan', '-', 'India', 'Pakistans', 'Himachal', 'Pradesh', 'Himalayan', 'Dharamsala', 'Manis', 'Himachal', 'Pradesh', 'Pakistan', 'PCB', 'India', 'Mani', 'Australias', 'Under', '-', '19', 'World', 'Cup', 'Bangladesh', 'Mani', 'Australian', 'ICC', 'Youth', 'World', 'Cup', 'Bangladesh', 'Mani', 'PCB', 'Dharamsala', 'Pakistans', 'Indo', '-', 'Pakistan', 'Mani', 'Pakistan', 'India', 'Dharamsala', 'Pakistan']","['I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC']"

He picked a spin-heavy attack comprising left-arm spinner Amir Hamza and leg-spinner Rashid Khan, to be followed by Samiullah Shenwari and Mohammad Nabi. The main seamer picked in the XI was Dawlat Zadran as they left out Hamid Hassan and Shapoor Zadran.Scotland's XI, on the other hand, was pace-reliant with Josh Davey, Alasdair Evans and Safyaan Sharif, even as captain Preston Mommsen said he was ""not too bothered"" about batting second. The lone frontline spinner included was 19-year-old left-arm spinner Mark Watt. Mommsen said they would look to restrict Afghanistan to under 150-160.Afghanistan: Mohammad Shahzad (wk), Noor Ali Zadran, Asghar Stanikzai (captain), Mohammad Nabi, Samiullah Shenwari, Najibullah Zadran, Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Rashid Khan, Shafiqullah, Amir HamzaScotland: Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Matthew Cross (wk), Matt Machan, Richie Berrington, Preston Mommsen (captain), George Munsey, Josh Davey, Safyaan Sharif, Mark Watt, Alasdair Evans  ",3/8/2016,Afghanistan win toss bat against Scotland,sports,"['NAGPUR', 'Afghanistan', 'Asghar', 'Stanikzai', 'Scotland', 'World', 'T20', 'Nagpur', '.', 'Stanikzai', '.', 'Stanikzai', '.', 'Amir', 'Hamza', 'Rashid', 'Khan', 'Samiullah', 'Shenwari', 'Mohammad', 'Nabi', '.', 'Dawlat', 'Zadran', 'Hamid', 'Hassan', 'Shapoor', 'Zadran', 'Scotland', 'Josh', 'Davey', 'Alasdair', 'Evans', 'Safyaan', 'Sharif', 'Preston', 'Mommsen', '.', 'Mark', 'Watt', 'Mommsen', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Mohammad', 'Shahzad', 'Noor', 'Ali', 'Zadran', 'Asghar', 'Stanikzai', 'Mohammad', 'Nabi', 'Samiullah', 'Shenwari', 'Najibullah', 'Zadran', 'Gulbadin', 'Naib', 'Dawlat', 'Zadran', 'Rashid', 'Khan', 'Shafiqullah', 'Amir', 'HamzaScotland', 'Kyle', 'Coetzer', 'Calum', 'MacLeod', 'Matthew', 'Cross', 'Matt', 'Machan', 'Richie', 'Berrington', 'Preston', 'Mommsen', 'George', 'Munsey', 'Josh', 'Davey', 'Safyaan', 'Sharif', 'Mark', 'Watt', 'Alasdair', 'Evans', '[SEP]']","['I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER']"

Andrews, a Fox sportscaster who used to work for ESPN, had sought $75 million in damages.""We're disappointed with the outcome,"" defense attorney Marc Dedman told reporters. He said he would consult with his clients - the hotel owners and its former operators - on whether they would appeal.Jurors began deliberating on Monday morning after the two-week trial concluded on Friday.""I've been honored by all the support from victims around the world. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyone's safety, security and privacy,"" Andrews said in a brief statement on her Twitter feed.Andrews testified for two days during the trial, saying that since the video was seen by millions of people, she experienced serious mental injury, including depression, crying spells and sleeplessness.Her lawyers argued that the hotel was negligent and could have prevented the incident.The video was taken by Michael David Barrett, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to stalking Andrews and making the video. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.Barrett asked the hotel to put him in a room next to Andrews' after an employee confirmed to him that she was staying there on a certain date. He rigged a peep hole to shoot the video of Andrews while she was changing.Lawyers for the hotel argued that the responsibility was solely Barrett's and there was no way the hotel could have foreseen what he did.The parties who were found liable were West End Hotel Partners, the investment group that owned the Nashville Marriott, and the operating company of the hotel at the time, Windsor Capital Group. Marriott International was originally named in Andrews' lawsuit, but the judge removed it.The jury found that the hotel is liable for 49 percent of the $55 million in damages, or $26.95 million, while Barrett is liable for 51 percent of the damages, equivalent to $28.05 million.",3/8/2016,Jury finds hotel liable in Erin Andrews stalker video ,sports,"['Nashville', 'Erin', 'Andrews', 'strongAndrews', 'Nashville', 'Marriott', 'Vanderbilt', 'University', 'Andrews', 'Fox', 'ESPN', 'Marc', 'Dedman', 'Andrews', 'Andrews', 'Michael', 'David', 'Barrett', 'Andrews', 'Barrett', 'Andrews', 'Andrews', 'Barrett', 'The', 'West', 'End', 'Hotel', 'Partners', 'Nashville', 'Marriott', 'Windsor', 'Capital', 'Group', 'Marriott', 'International', 'Andrews', 'Barrett']","['I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG']"

The game had swung in nearly every over as neither team could take a hold of the contest.Mudassar Bukhari and Pieter Seelaar kept Netherlands in the hunt with a 16-run penultimate over, which also included the wicket of Tom Cooper. Bukhari was run-out in the last over, and neither Seelaar nor Logan van Beek could find the boundaries.Ultimately, Tamim Iqbal's unbeaten 83, as the rest of the Bangladesh batting line-up struggled, Mashrafe Mortaza's boundary-less last three overs and Taskin's accurate last over combined for Bangladesh's win.The game was in Netherlands' grasp when they needed 54 runs in the last five overs with seven wickets in hand. Captain Peter Borren started off the assault with a one-handed sweep through midwicket for four. Subsequently, he was dropped in the same region by Nasir Hossain before the same fielder caught him at the end of the over.In the next over, Mortaza, who conceded one four in his spell, was unlucky not to have Cooper's wicket after the ball struck the off stump but the bails didn't budge.

Left-arm spinner Mark Watt gave generous flight as the ball gripped the cracked pitch and tested Jamie Atkinson with slow turn. Some balls turned like that, some skidded on, while others stopped on the batsmen.The trio of Watt, Con de Lange, and Matt Machan combined to send Hong Kong on a tail spin with figures of 12-0-66-4.Rain gave Hong Kong brief respite, and the contest was then reduced to a 10-over shootout, after which Scotland overhauled the revised target of 76 with ease.George Munsey kick-started the chase with a flurry of fours.

Javeria underwent a CT scan, and is understood to now be conscious.Sidra Ameen and Bismah Maroof steadied the innings with a patient 40-run stand, but three quick blows from Mohammed swung the contest decisively West Indies way.

By the end of the Powerplay, New Zealand were 48 for one and except for a couple of quiet overs, the pair found the boundary with ease.Devine fell in the 15th over to Isobel Joyce, after a 34-ball 47, and Bates then propelled the score past 150.The New Zealand captain struck two successive sixes off Kim Garth in the penultimate over before falling for 82; her knock also included seven fours.She became the fourth player to score more than 2000 runs in women's T20I cricket and is second on the list of highest run-getters with 2063 runs, ahead of Sarah Taylor and Stafanie Taylor.Ireland's chase simply failed to get off the blocks. They lost two wickets within the first four overs for a score of 16 and by the tenth over had reached only 34 for 3.The required run rate was already more than 14 by that stage and it was only Joyce who showed some resistance with a 33-ball 28, the top score in an Ireland innings that eventually petered out to 84 for 5.Offspinner Leigh Kasperek had economical returns of 1-10 in her four overs while legspinner Erin Bermingham took 2 for 17. ",3/18/2016,New Zealand crush Ireland in Womens World T20,sports,"['MOHALI', 'Suzie', 'Bates', 'Sophie', 'Devine', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Women', 'Ireland', 'Women', 'World', 'T20', 'Mohali', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Rachel', 'Priest', 'Amy', 'Kenealy', 'Bates', 'Devine', 'Powerplay', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Devine', 'Isobel', 'Joyce', 'Bates', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Kim', 'Garth', 'T20I', 'Sarah', 'Taylor', 'Stafanie', 'Taylor', 'Ireland', 'Joyce', 'Ireland', 'Leigh', 'Kasperek', 'Erin', 'Bermingham']","['I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER']"

With just one game remaining, England will book their berth in the semi-finals with a victory, but a loss - by any margin - will see them eliminated since their net run rate is lower than that of South Africa.Teams:England: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Jos Buttler (wk), Eoin Morgan (captain), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Liam PlunkettSri Lanka: Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Milinda Siriwardana, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews (captain), Chamara Kapugedera, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Rangana Herath, Dushmantha Chameera, Jeffrey Vandersay ",3/26/2016,Sri Lanka win toss bowl against England,sports,"['Sri', 'Lanka', 'Angelo', 'Mathews', 'England', 'Super', 'Ten', 'Group', 'One', 'World', 'Twenty20', 'Feroz', 'Shah', 'Kotla', '.', 'Sachithra', 'Senanayake', 'England', 'Nuwan', 'Kulasekara', 'Dasun', 'Shanaka', 'Alex', 'Hales', 'James', 'Vince', 'England', '.', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'South', 'Africa', '.', 'England', 'South', 'Africa', '.', 'England', 'Jason', 'Roy', 'Alex', 'Hales', 'Joe', 'Root', 'Jos', 'Buttler', 'Eoin', 'Morgan', 'Ben', 'Stokes', 'Moeen', 'Ali', 'Chris', 'Jordan', 'David', 'Willey', 'Adil', 'Rashid', 'Liam', 'PlunkettSri', 'Lanka', 'Dinesh', 'Chandimal', 'Tillakaratne', 'Dilshan', 'Milinda', 'Siriwardana', 'Lahiru', 'Thirimanne', 'Angelo', 'Mathews', 'Chamara', 'Kapugedera', 'Thisara', 'Perera', 'Dasun', 'Shanaka', 'Rangana', 'Herath', 'Dushmantha', 'Chameera', 'Jeffrey', 'Vandersay', '[SEP]']","['I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER']"

Waqar took the decision after meeting PCB officials in Lahore.</strongThe two resignations came after Pakistan's disappointing performances in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh and the World T20 in India. Pakistan won only three games out of the eight they played across the two tournaments and failed to make it beyond the first round. The last series Pakistan won in any format was last October, when they beat England 2-0 in a three-Test series in the UAE. After that, Pakistan lost the ODI and T20 series to England, and then traveled to New Zealand to again lose the T20 and ODI series. They won only two of the 12 limited-overs matches they played in all against England and New Zealand. Pakistan are currently ranked a respectable fourth in Tests, but eighth in ODIs and seventh in T20s in the ICC rankings.Waqar had recently presented a scathing report, after Pakistan's exit from the World T20, in which he criticised the PCB's decision of not giving him a say in the selection process and lambasted Afridi's style of captaincy. The report was an overview of his two-year term as coach and was submitted to PCB chairman Shahryar Khan and to the board's fact-finding committee.A day before submitting that report, Waqar had offered to step down but had said cosmetic changes would be insufficient to solve the deeper issues in Pakistan cricket.It was Waqar's second tenure as coach after he was appointed in May 2014 for a two-year contract. His first stint as head coach was in 2010-11 and he had then resigned citing personal reasons. ",4/4/2016,Waqar Younis steps down as head ,sports,"['LAHORE', 'Waqar', 'Younis', 'Pakistan', 'Shahid', 'Afridi', 'T20', 'Waqar', 'PCB', 'Lahore', 'Pakistan', 'Asia', 'Cup', 'Bangladesh', 'World', 'T20', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'England', 'Test', 'UAE', 'Pakistan', 'ODI', 'T20', 'England', 'New', 'Zealand', 'T20', 'ODI', 'England', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Pakistan', 'Tests', 'ODIs', 'T20s', 'ICC', 'Waqar', 'Pakistan', 'World', 'T20', 'PCB', 'Afridi', 'PCB', 'Shahryar', 'Khan', 'Waqar', 'Pakistan', 'Waqar']","['I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER']"

1196,"SYDNEY: A revamp of home international scheduling will mean Brisbane loses the first Test of next summer and pink ball matches will be played against both touring nations, South Africa and Pakistan, Aussies media reported on Wednesday.Cricket Australia is finalising its international domestic and Big Bash League schedules for the 2016-17 season with an announcement expected this month.There are changes a foot with the Gabba to forfeit hosting rights to the first Test of the season and instead feature elsewhere in the calendar as host to the opening match of the Australia-Pakistan series set to be a day-night match in December.In its place, the Test summer will kick off between Australia and South Africa at the WACA in November with the ability for the match to be beamed into lounge rooms on the east coast at prime time weighing heavily in Perths favour.The series against the Proteas will head to Hobart which has been retained as a Test venue next summer amid competition from Canberra before wrapping up under lights at Adelaide Oval, the scene of last years historic first pink ball Test.Australia will then meet Pakistan in a day-night match at the Gabba and complete that series with marquee Tests in Melbourne and Sydney.Brisbane has struggled to attract decent Test crowds outside Ashes years but by beginning the summer in Perth, there is a belief that attendance numbers should be boosted by the citys strong expatriate South African population.By holding a second day-night Test in Brisbane officials hope to replicate the success of the inaugural pink ball showpiece between Australia and New Zealand last November.Another key point of contention had been whether Canberra would be granted a first-ever Test.

1217,"KOLKATA: Mitchell McClenaghan walked out at No. 4 for Mumbai Indians. It is not like the side is short of hitters but Jos Buttler caught fire only after the spark provided by McClenaghan's eight-ball 20. The events between the 11th and the 15th overs of the chase decided the winner of the match - Mumbai, by six wickets.McClenaghan's responsibility - under normal circumstances - was to slip into Lasith Malinga's shoes. Be the wicket-taker at the start and the enforcer at the end. Today, he was asked to disrupt the Kolkata Knight Riders' rhythm. And he was given the freedom to do so. Every single shot played by the New Zealand fast bowler was a slog. His second, third and fourth balls cleared the Eden Gardens boundaries. The eighth - a wide full toss that he tried to slog sweep - led to his downfall but by then Mumbai had regained lost momentum. And Buttler simply ran with it.A straight drive against chinaman Brad Hogg was followed by a pulled six. The equation shrunk from 101 off 60 balls to 49 off 30. A scoop to the fine leg boundary - which established Buttler's finesse - and two lofted cover drives - which established his power - deflated Knight Riders. Gautam Gambhir, who had taken the record (27) for the most fifties in the IPL earlier in the night, watched the ball soar and the chances for his team sink with every minute Buttler was on strike.When Buttler eventually fell for 41 off 22 balls, the Mumbai captain, Rohit Sharma, back at his preferred opening position, provided more evidence of why he should be given as many overs as possible in a T20 game. Rohit held the innings together and even finished it off with an array of beautiful shots - a straight six and a deft glide to third man.

1218,"LONDON: New Zealands Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson as well as Australia captain Steven Smith have been chosen among the Wisden Almanacks Five Cricketers of the Year, announced Wednesday.The quintet is completed by the England duo of all rounder Ben Stokes and Jonathan Bairstow.In the personal gift of the editor of crickets bible, which has been published annually since 1864, a player can only be named as a Cricketer of the Year once in his career.Generally the award is decided on players performances in the previous English season and Australias Smith was included when, despite his side being beaten 3-2 in the Ashes, he emerged as the series leading run-scorer with a double century at Lords and 143 at The Oval in the visitors two wins.The 2016 edition also saw New Zealand batsman Williamson named as the Leading Cricketer in the World, after his 2,692 international runs across the formats in 2015,   the third highest annual aggregate ever.McCullum, who retired this year, was included as much for his bold captaincy as his aggressive batting with New Zealands dynamic approach widely reckoned to have helped transform Englands play in both Test and one-day cricket as well.Williamson and McCullum were not the only New Zealanders honoured by Wisden, with compatriot Suzie Bates, chosen as the womens Leading Cricketer.Stokes was one of the stars of Englands Ashes success while wicketkeeper batsman Bairstow also played his part as well as helping Yorkshire win the County Championship.During Englands recent tour of South Africa, the pair shared a monumental stand of 399, which featured Stokess blistering 258 and Bairstows maiden Test century.Wisden editor Lawrence Booth praised England for their revival after their embarrassingly early exit at the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. ",4/13/2016,Wisden honour for McCullum and Willi,sports,"['New', 'Zealands', 'Brendon', 'McCullum', 'Kane', 'Williamson', 'Australia', 'Steven', 'Smith', 'Wisden', 'Almanacks', 'Five', 'Cricketers', 'England', 'Ben', 'Stokes', 'Jonathan', 'Bairstow', 'Cricketer', 'English', 'Australias', 'Smith', 'Ashes', 'Lords', 'The', 'Oval', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Williamson', 'Cricketer', 'World', 'McCullum', 'New', 'Zealands', 'Englands', 'Test', 'Williamson', 'McCullum', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'Wisden', 'Suzie', 'Bates', 'Cricketer', 'Stokes', 'Englands', 'Ashes', 'Bairstow', 'Yorkshire', 'County', 'Championship', 'Englands', 'South', 'Africa', 'Stokess', 'Bairstows', 'Test', 'Wisden', 'Lawrence', 'Booth', 'England', 'World', 'Cup', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand']","['I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC']"

1222,"NEW YORK: Maria Sharapova and scores of other athletes who have tested positive for meldonium could be handed a lifeline after the World Anti-Doping Agency said there was a lack of scientific evidence about how long the drug stays in the system.Amid growing confusion about the status of an avalanche of positive tests for the drug, which was banned on 1 January this year, Wada said its preliminary tests showed that it could take weeks or months for the drug to leave the body. In such cases, athletes could not reasonably have known or suspected that the drug would still be present in their bodies after 1 January, said WADA in a clarification paper to its code signatories on how they should prosecute meldonium cases.In these circumstances Wada considers that there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete, it added. Sir Craig Reedie, the president of Wada, said: It is designed to explain the science that we know. The issue that it deals with is the time this drug takes to come out of the system. Its an attempt to clarify the many questions that weve been asked.The Russian sports ministry and national Olympic committee welcomed the Wada statement, and the countrys officials suggested there could be a mass amnesty of Russian athletes.The head of the Russian tennis federation (RTF), Shamil Tarpishchev, told the R-Sport agency he hoped Sharapova would be able to play at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August, while the head of the Russian swimming federation suggested there could be a swift return to competition for the suspended world champion Yulia Efimova.A Wada spokesman said talk of an amnesty was wide of the mark and that the document was designed to clarify the position.Sharapova confirmed last month that she had tested positive for meldonium during the Australian Open.

With Pakistan, it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness, Flower told ESPNCricinfo.You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting.<br/> If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said.Flower said, our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice.

Asked by the judge whether Messi would attend Thursday's hearing, the lawyer said he would.The case centres on the player's image rights and a web of shell companies allegedly used to evade taxes on income from those rights. Tuesday's hearing showed that Spain's tax office made 20 inspections of Messi during its two-year investigation.According to the prosecutors' office, revenue was hidden using shell companies in Uruguay, Belize, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Messi and his father paid five million euros to the tax authorities as a ""corrective"" measure after being formally investigated in June 2013.In addition to Messi, Spain's tax office has also begun investigating the finances of high-profile Barcelona players such as Neymar Jr, Javier Mascherano and Adriano.A resident in Barcelona since 2000, Messi became a Spanish citizen in 2005.

But he moved like a lightweight. So he floated like a butterfly and he did sting like a bee because his shots were fast, powerful and explosive. And he used to hurt his guys, you know, he hurt his opponents.In addition to being widely regarded as the best boxer in history, Ali was outspoken in his fight for social justice, becoming a key figure in the civil rights movement and a leading voice against the US war in Vietnam.He also raised millions of dollars for charity, including his own organisation dedicated to Parkinsons research, a disease he suffered from 1984 onwards.Khan said: I look up to him and I wanna do what he did.

With his approval ratings barely into double digits, he is battling nationwide strikes against labour law reforms, stubbornly high unemployment and deep rifts within the ruling Socialist Party.Asked for his parting thoughts on France, Ibrahimovic said: ""Ibra came and he seized power in France.""",6/7/2016,Ibrahimovic says can boost dismal popularity of Frances Holland,sports,"['Zlatan', 'Ibrahimovic', 'French', 'Francois', 'Hollande', 'Sweden', 'French', 'Paris', 'Saint', 'Germain', 'Hollande', 'Le', 'Monde', 'Ibrahimovic', 'Euro', '2016', 'France', 'Sweden', 'PSG', 'France', 'Hollande', 'Hollande', 'France', 'Fifth', 'Republic', 'Ibrahimovic', 'French', 'Swede', 'PSG', 'Hollande', 'Elysee', 'Ligue', '1', 'Hollande', 'Socialist', 'Party', 'France', 'Ibrahimovic', 'Ibra', 'France']","['I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC']"
1444,"strong>LONDON: The record books were rewritten twice in an astonishing run spree at Nottinghamshire's Trent Bridge ground on Monday which saw a record English one-day partnership and the most aggregate runs scored in a List A match.</strongBy the close in the Royal London One-Day Cup game between Notts and Northamptonshire, statisticians were checking to see if there had ever been a day like it anywhere in the world.The big hitting began from the start with Nottinghamshire's Riki Wessels and Michael Lumb sharing a record one-day partnership in England of 342 from 39.2 overs.Wessels eventually departed for a career-best 146, from 97 balls, while Lumb went on to make 184, also his best and a record for the county, as Nottinghamshire posted 445 for 8, the second highest score for a List A match in the world.The runs continued to flow when Northamptonshire chased down what would have been another record for a team batting second. But they fell short despite 128 from Rory Kleinveldt.Their total of 425 gave Nottinghamshire victory by 20 runs in a game which saw an unprecedented 870 runs scored in the day, three more than Surrey and Glamorgan managed in 2002.Afterwards Lumb joked: ""It was a bit twitchy. What a great game of cricket. Never in doubt.""I was surprised they took it that deep but it's credit to them. Rory Kleinveldt was unbelievable. It was an unbelievable game. I don't think we could do too much more. I'm proud of all the boys.""The Nottinghamshire stand beat the previous record in England of 318 by Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid for India against Sri Lanka at Taunton in the 1999 World Cup.Lumb and Wessels' English record is the third-highest partnership in List A games, behind the 372 which Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels took off Zimbabwe in the 2015 World Cup.The record for the highest team total is held by Surrey, who made 496-4 against Gloucestershire in 2007.List A matches are played over 40-60 overs.",6/7/2016,Records tumble in English county one day g,sports,"['Nottinghamshire', 'Trent', 'Bridge', 'English', 'List', 'A', 'Royal', 'London', 'One', '-', 'Day', 'Cup', 'Notts', 'Northamptonshire', 'Nottinghamshire', 'Riki', 'Wessels', 'Michael', 'Lumb', 'England', 'Wessels', 'Lumb', 'Nottinghamshire', 'List', 'A', 'Northamptonshire', 'Rory', 'Kleinveldt', 'Nottinghamshire', 'Surrey', 'Glamorgan', 'Lumb', 'Rory', 'Kleinveldt', 'Nottinghamshire', 'England', 'Sourav', 'Ganguly', 'Rahul', 'Dravid', 'India', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Taunton', 'World', 'Cup', 'Lumb', 'Wessels', 'English', 'List', 'A', 'Chris', 'Gayle', 'Marlon', 'Samuels', 'Zimbabwe', 'World', 'Cup', 'Surrey', 'Gloucestershire', 'List', 'A']","['I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC']"

The whole of Europe will be watching.""Up to 90,000 police and private security guards will protect players and supporters, just seven months after coordinated Islamic State attacks in Paris killed 130 people.The stringent security measures got their first real test on Thursday when superstar French DJ David Guetta gave a free performance in the fan zone at the foot of the Eiffel Tower where some 80,000 spectators had to pass through two checkpoints.The government is eager to make sure the championship goes off without a hitch, but weeks of protests and industrial action have provided a sombre prelude to Europe´s four-yearly football extravaganza.As hundreds of thousands of fans began pouring into the capital ahead of the football action, a train strike rumbled into its ninth day on Thursday, while bags of rubbish piled up on the streets.Rail workers have threatened fresh disruption on Friday on the lines serving the Stade de France.Environment Minister Segolene Royal appealed to unions to end their strike disruption, warning they were endangering the image of France, which is bidding to host the 2024 Olympics.",6/10/2016,Euro 2016 kicks off in France despite strikes and terror thr,sports,"['PARIS', 'Euro', '2016', 'France', 'Francois', 'Hollande', 'France', 'Romania', 'Stade', 'de', 'France', 'Paris', 'GMT', 'Hollande', 'Hollande', 'Europe', 'Islamic', 'State', 'Paris', 'French', 'David', 'Guetta', 'Eiffel', 'Europe´s', 'Stade', 'de', 'France', 'Segolene', 'Royal', 'France', 'Olympics']","['I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC']"

1552,"BIRMINGHAM: Sri Lanka were left sweating on the fitness of captain Angelo Mathews for the second one-day international against England after the all rounder was rated 70 percent following Thursday s practice session.Fridays match at Edgbaston is a day night clash, starting at 1300 GMT so the tourists do have a little extra time in which key all rounder Mathews can demonstrate he has recovered fully from a hamstring strain.The injury meant Mathews was off the field when England tailender Liam Plunkett struck the last ball of the match for six to seal a spectacular tie in Tuesdays opening contest of a five match series at Trent Bridge.By that stage, Mathews had already underlined his worth to Sri Lanka by top scoring with 73 in a total of 286 for nine and then taking two early wickets with his medium pace as England collapsed to 30 for four and 82 for six.If he is sidelined on Friday, off- spinner Suraj Randiv is likely to come into the team with wicket keeper Dinesh Chandimal taking over as captain.Mathews took no part in the squad s full practice session at Edgbaston in Birmingham central England on Thursday but did some stretching before being able to run at an estimated 70 percent by a team spokesman and then putting his pads on to face a tennis ball on the outfield.Earlier opener Danushka Gunathilaka emphasised Mathews s importance to Sri Lanka by saying He s the key man in the middle order for us and he played a brilliant knock (at Trent Bridge).Hes very important for our next four matches and we hope he will get well soon and play the next one.Gunathilaka set to win his 10th ODI cap on Friday said Mathews s advice had been helpful in his fledgling international career.He gave me a lot of confidence   thats been really helpful to me he said.Gunathilaka managed only nine at Nottinghams Trent Bridge on Tuesday before being caught behind off left arm paceman David Willey.",6/24/2016,Sri Lankas Mathews doubtful for 2nd ODI,sports,"['Sri', 'Lanka', 'Angelo', 'Mathews', 'England', 'Edgbaston', 'GMT', 'Mathews', 'Mathews', 'England', 'Liam', 'Plunkett', 'Trent', 'Bridge', 'Mathews', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'England', 'Suraj', 'Randiv', 'Dinesh', 'Chandimal', 'Mathews', 'Edgbaston', 'Birmingham', 'England', 'Danushka', 'Gunathilaka', 'Mathews', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Trent', 'Bridge', 'Gunathilaka', 'ODI', 'Mathews', 'Gunathilaka', 'Nottinghams', 'Trent', 'Bridge', 'David', 'Willey']","['I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER']"

Under Cricket Australia (CA) contracts, players are given a six-week break from commitments, which many use to sign lucrative IPL contracts.Lehmann said that while the financial incentive to play in India was tempting, it often wore players out and the ICC should use a common sense approach to future scheduling so that the toll on bodies was not too high.""If it keeps going like this, with players playing IPL as well, they are inevitably going to break down,"" Lehmann told Australian media on Friday.""Hopefully changes will happen at the ICC and then you will see a refined schedule which will be better.""Lehmann said while players often consider setting themselves up for life by playing in the IPL, it was a ""tough conundrum"" for national selectors, as they are reluctant to advise players not to take on out-of-contract commitments.""If you look across a two-year cycle, all of our players have had to come home at some point,"" he said, while referring to injuries Steve Smith (wrist) and Mitchell Marsh (hamstring) picked up in the most recent IPL season.Lehmann believes that while players may be primed to perform under match day stresses, it was the constant travel, variable conditions and lack of adequate rest which was putting them most at risk.""It's not so much the cricket; it's the travel to these places.

The pinch-hitter said that the type of talent that was coming up in Pakistan did not match with the cricket demand in the country. ""We always say that Pakistan has very talented cricketers.

He said that the bowler was mentally very strong and expressed the hope that Amir would fulfill the expectations that everyone had from him. In response to a question about Mohommad Amir playing for the first time after his spot-fixing scandal, Afridi stated that it was an old practice of the British media to pressurize any cricketer they viewed as a threat before an important series. On the issue of retirement, Afridi said he had never been a burden on the national cricket team.

Balochistan Sports Minister Mir Mujeebur Rehman announced a Rs0.5 million prize for Muhammad Waseem after his victory.Initially it was an ordinary fight but WBC last month turned it into a world silver title fight.

Jeff is the uncle of Floyd Mayweather Junior, one of the worlds greatest boxers of his time.Waseem comes across as one of the most capable and promising young boxers that Pakistan has produced in recent times.Before this match, Waseem had played only three fights and won them all.The Pakistani boxer, who switched over to pro boxing early last year, made a dream debut when he knocked out.Koreas Min Wook Lee in the ninth round to win the Korean Boxing Commission (KBC) title on October 4, 2015.He knocked out Suparyanto Doglo of Indonesia in the third round in his second bout in Bangkok on December 5, 2015.His last triumph came against Indonesias Bajawa whom he knocked out in Seoul the other month.Waseem is a rare fighter as he began his pro career directly with a ten-round fight.

George Lohmann, the England fast bowler, had reached the mark in 16 Tests in 1896.Yasir had been ranked No. 4 before the start of the series, but a compelling display on a day two pitch offering no turn and remarkable exploitation of a wearing pitch and worried batsmen on day four pushed him up three places.His 6 for 72 in the first innings and 4 for 69 in the second made him the first legspinner ever to claim a 10-for at Lord's.

She will be joined in Rio by another runner, Abu Al-Jadail, who will run in the 100 metres. Omair will participate in fencing, while Fahmi will be in the under-52 kg judo event.Women in Saudi Arabia face significant hurdles to practice sport. They must wear head-to-toe garments in public, observe strict rules on gender segregation and obtain permission from a male guardian to travel, study or marry.Women's gyms are not currently eligible for licences, making them scarce in the kingdom.

It is thought a coach will join the squad for the winter tours of India and Bangladesh, where spin will be prominent. Saqlain is one of the contenders for the role while Daniel Vettori, the former New Zealand left-arm spinner, recently spent time with the England Performance Programme at a training camp in Dubai. Robert Croft, who played 21 Tests, was recruited for a part of last winters tour of South Africa. Mushtaq Ahmed worked closely with Graeme Swann during his time with England, helping Swann become one of the worlds best spinners.

After delivering his second ball of the 22nd over, with Pakistan 68 for two, the Durham pace bowler pulled up with a right calf strain and left the field.Later, Ali dismissed both Hafeez (42) and Younis Khan (28) in a spell of two for 13 in 19 balls.Hafeez gave a simple bat/pad catch to Gary Ballance at short leg.<br/> Pakistan´s 83 for three became 102 for four when Younis, trying to loft Ali over the top, was caught at long-on.It was a reckless shot from such an experienced player given that Pakistan needed to bat time to escape with a draw and that there was man deep in the field waiting for a chance.Misbah too needlessly chanced his arm in hitting Ali for six.But having made a patient 52 in Pakistan´s meagre first innings 198, Misbah was unlucky to fall to Chris Woakes for 35 when he dragged a full toss onto his stumps.Earlier, England declared their second innings on 173 for one.

1746,"strong>JAMAICA: West Indies have added 19-year-old fast bowler Alzarri Joseph to their squad for the second test against India starting in Jamaica on Saturday.</strongJoseph brings genuine pace to a West Indies attack that struggled for penetration in a lopsided innings and 92-run defeat in the first test in Antigua last week.The Antiguan teenager earned selection after impressing in the under-19 World Cup won by West Indies in February. He bowled the fastest delivery of the tournament, clocked at 143 kilometres per hour.Joseph has played just eight first class matches, picking up 24 wickets at an average of a tad over 24.West Indies veteran Marlon Samuels described Joseph as young, fit, fast and fearless and chairman of selectors Courtney Browne thought the youngster was ready for promotion.""We feel that Alzarri  will now benefit from the professional guidance of our coaching staff and the presence of fast bowling legend Joel Garner as manager,"" Browne said.Josephs addition brings the squad to 14 players, with nobody dropped after the first test, where India piled up 566 for eight declared.Shannon Gabriel was the only genuine quick in that line-up, backed by fast-medium exponents Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite.Early reports suggest the pitch at Sabina Park in Kingston may be green and give the fast bowlers some assistance in the second of the four tests in the series.West Indies also underperformed with the bat in the first test, compiling scores of only 243 and 231.Samuels, who scored one and 50, says it is time he raised his test batting to the level of his performances in Twenty20 and One Day Internationals.He averages only 33.39 in test matches, less than his ODI average and not far shy of his Twenty20 average.I havent been getting the runs Ive been looking for in the test arena but Ive been making up in the shorter version, the 35-year-old said.Its up to me to focus more and (put) in some big performance so the team can benefit.He said he felt a lot of pressure and was aware he needed to temper his aggression at times and focus on occupying the crease.Im batting at four, so I have to dominate.

The global benchmark touched $51.72 during the session, its highest since June 10. U.S. crude was up 75 cents at $49.44.Analysts are expecting a rise in crude stocks of 2.6 million barrels.But another drop in U.S. crude stocks would reinforce the view that the supply glut that has been weighing on prices since 2014 is easing. The API data, however, does not always tally with the EIA data, which is due at 1430 GMT.""All eyes now turn to the EIA crude inventory numbers,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, adding that another confirmed drawdown in crude stocks would likely push U.S. crude prices above $50.Brent has risen from below $49 on Sept. 28, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a surprise cut in its output to support prices which are less than half the level of mid-2014.Under the deal, OPEC will target production of between 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33.0 million bpd, implying a cut of as much as 740,000 bpd from the August level, as reported in OPEC's monthly report.The move marked an about-face by OPEC, which in November 2014 dropped its role of cutting production. Although it hasn't yet worked out all the details, and analysts are skeptical the cut will be implemented, the deal is supporting the market.""The mere threat of a production cut should put a floor under oil prices until the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30,"" said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies.",10/5/2016,Oil hits highest since June on possible US inventory dr,business,"['LONDON', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'OPEC', 'American', 'Petroleum', 'Institute', 'API', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'Energy', 'Information', 'Administration', 'EIA', 'Brent', 'GMT', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'API', 'EIA', 'GMT', 'EIA', 'Jeffrey', 'Halley', 'OANDA', 'Singapore', 'U', '.', 'S', '.', 'Brent', 'Organization', 'of', 'the', 'Petroleum', 'Exporting', 'Countries', 'OPEC', 'OPEC', 'OPEC', 'OPEC', 'Jason', 'Gammel', 'U', 'S', 'Jefferies']","['I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG']"

The bold step to fight corruption has left Indians queuing outside bank branches since Wednesday to swap old notes for legal tender, bringing parts of the nation's economy to a standstill.</strongThe pain is most palpable for the informal sector, which accounts for almost half of GDP and the vast majority of employment. Tendering old notes above a minimal value for new ones requires a bank account, but 40 percent of the population is outside of the formal banking system. No wonder tensions are running high.If Modi can ride out the immediate backlash, though, demonetisation could potentially provide a big fiscal boost. Suppose that holders of one-fifth of the notes in circulation will not try to exchange them out of fear of attracting scrutiny from tax authorities. That means currency worth almost $50 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, could suddenly become worthless.In theory that would sharply reduce the monetary liabilities of the Reserve Bank of India, and brokerage Edelweiss reckons that in turn could allow the central bank to pay a higher dividend to the government. Other economists suggest this may not be legally possible, but the RBI does face pressure each year to boost its payouts to New Delhi.A windfall could help India boost spending while meeting its ambitious plan to narrow the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by March 2018. It would give Modi the funds for big-ticket items such as a recapitalization of the nation's ailing state-backed lenders, which could require more than $30 billion.The twin effects of a slowdown in economic activity and the reduction in money supply should also bring down inflation, making room for more interest rate cuts, which could boost growth in the medium term.The recall is certainly working: Banks have already collected a staggering $44 billion of deposits in barely five days. Modi clearly hopes that it will do the economy more good than harm once the initial shock of last week's move wears off. Either way, it could prove central to his legacy.",11/14/2016,Cash bet could make break Modi,business,"['Narendra', 'Modi', 'India', 'Indians', 'Modi', 'Reserve', 'Bank', 'of', 'India', 'Edelweiss', 'RBI', 'New', 'Delhi', 'India', 'Modi', 'Modi']","['I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER']"

Pakistan hopes that some industry will relocate from China, due to cheaper wages and production costs, Iqbal said.""Our preferred mode is joint ventures, because that will give a stake to both Pakistani and Chinese enterprises so now our government is actively promoting business-to-business links,"" he said.",11/24/2016,China to make extra 85 bn investments in Pakistan rail energy,business,"['Pakistan', 'Beijing', 'Ahsan', 'Iqbal', 'China', '-', 'Pakistan', 'Economic', 'Corridor', 'CPEC', 'Pakistan', 'China', 'Gwadar', 'Arabian', 'Sea', 'Pakistan', 'Karachi', 'Peshawar', 'Iqbal', 'Reuters', 'LNG', 'Iqbal', 'International', 'Monetary', 'Fund', 'CPEC', 'Pakistan', 'Iqbal', 'IMF', 'Pakistan', 'China', 'CPEC', 'Pakistan', 'China', 'Iqbal', 'Pakistani', 'Chinese']","['I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-PER', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-PER', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC']"

In November COMAC said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers.China is one of the Western manufacturers´ key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers.The country´s airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast.Boeing´s expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion.To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms, even as Beijing hopes to oust them with homegrown aircraft.Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers.Boeing last year announced plans to open a facility with COMAC to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said.COMAC has also developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ21, which took to the skies in its first commercial flight last June.",2/6/2017,Made in China large passenger plane targets 2017 debu,business,"['China´s', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'C919', 'People´s', 'Daily', 'Commercial', 'Aircraft', 'Corp', 'of', 'China', 'COMAC', 'China', 'European', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'United', 'States', 'C919', 'Boeing', '737', 'Airbus', 'A320', 'COMAC', 'China', 'Western', 'Airbus', 'Boeing´s', 'Chinese', 'Beijing', 'Airbus', 'Tianjin', 'It', 'Chinese', 'Boeing', 'COMAC', '737', 'Chinese', 'COMAC', 'ARJ21']","['I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-LOC', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-MISC', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG']"

It was already controlling horse racing and lottery assets.Ozgur Altug, economist at BGC Capital in Istanbul, said he estimated the value of the transferred assets to be $33 billion.

1957,"strong>RIYADH/DUBAI: Saudi Arabia plans to tighten restrictions on foreign workers to pressure companies into hiring more Saudi citizens and reduce unemployment among Saudis, government sources said on Monday.</strongThe new policy could help the kingdom achieve one goal of economic reforms launched last year to ease joblessness among Saudis from the current 12.1 percent to 9 percent by 2020.But by making it harder for firms to employ low-paid foreign workers, thereby raising costs, the policy may complicate other aspects of the reform drive such as developing private sector businesses and diversifying the economy beyond oil.The new rules could potentially affect large numbers of people since about 12 million foreigners work in Saudi Arabia, doing many of the strenuous, dangerous and lower-paid jobs shunned by 20 million Saudi citizens. About two-thirds of Saudi workers are employed by the public sector.Under a program launched in 2011 and known as Nitaqat, the Labor Ministry grades firms according to the ratios of Saudis in their workforces. Companies with higher ratios get preferential treatment when obtaining visas for foreign workers or licenses; those in lower categories face penalties.Under the new policy, construction firms with between 500 and 2,999 workers would have to employ 100 percent Saudis to be in the top ""platinum"" category; if they employ 10 percent, they are rated ""lower green"". This compares to current levels of 16 percent for platinum and 6 percent for lower green.In the retail sector, a large company's current percentages are 35 percent for platinum and 24 percent for lower green. This would rise to 100 percent for platinum and 35 percent for lower green, according to an official document seen by Reuters.Policy will also tightened in many other sectors, according to the document, which lists more than 60 industries in which restrictions will be applied.Some change is already occurring in Saudi employment practice, with many citizens now working as cashiers and sales people in retail shops - the sort of jobs previously seen as undesirable. But there is still a scarcity of Saudis willing and qualified to work in the construction sector.The tighter policy has been approved by Labor Minister Ali bin Nasser al-Ghafis, the sources said.

1968,"strong>RIYADH/DUBAI: Saudi Arabia plans to tighten restrictions on foreign workers to pressure companies into hiring more Saudi citizens and reduce unemployment among Saudis, government sources said on Monday.</strongThe new policy could help the kingdom achieve one goal of economic reforms launched last year to ease joblessness among Saudis from the current 12.1 percent to 9 percent by 2020.But by making it harder for firms to employ low-paid foreign workers, thereby raising costs, the policy may complicate other aspects of the reform drive such as developing private sector businesses and diversifying the economy beyond oil.The new rules could potentially affect large numbers of people since about 12 million foreigners work in Saudi Arabia, doing many of the strenuous, dangerous and lower-paid jobs shunned by 20 million Saudi citizens. About two-thirds of Saudi workers are employed by the public sector.Under a program launched in 2011 and known as Nitaqat, the Labor Ministry grades firms according to the ratios of Saudis in their workforces. Companies with higher ratios get preferential treatment when obtaining visas for foreign workers or licenses; those in lower categories face penalties.Under the new policy, construction firms with between 500 and 2,999 workers would have to employ 100 percent Saudis to be in the top ""platinum"" category; if they employ 10 percent, they are rated ""lower green"". This compares to current levels of 16 percent for platinum and 6 percent for lower green.In the retail sector, a large company's current percentages are 35 percent for platinum and 24 percent for lower green. This would rise to 100 percent for platinum and 35 percent for lower green, according to an official document seen by Reuters.Policy will also tightened in many other sectors, according to the document, which lists more than 60 industries in which restrictions will be applied.Some change is already occurring in Saudi employment practice, with many citizens now working as cashiers and sales people in retail shops - the sort of jobs previously seen as undesirable. But there is still a scarcity of Saudis willing and qualified to work in the construction sector.The tighter policy has been approved by Labor Minister Ali bin Nasser al-Ghafis, the sources said.
